This Thesis with the title "Agent-Based Model of High-Frequency Trading" and supervised by Prof. Schmedders
builds an extensible, robust implementation of the agent-based model presented in "Rock around the Clock: 
An Agent-Based Model of Low- and High-Frequency Trading" by Jacob Leal et al. (2016). This model is used to 
study the interplay of low- and high-frequency traders and to observe their effect on asset price dynamics.
